# BasicCharts-Matplotlib
Learnt how to make basic visualization in Matplotlip in a Jupyter notebook. It has Line Charts, Bar Charts, Histograms, Pie Charts and Box and Whisker. Each Chart is used to represent a different visualization for better understanding.

eg. 
* Histograms can be used for continuous data data to represent frequency,
* Bar Charts and Pie Charts can be used for Categorical data to show frequency,
* Pie Charts are more overly used to show percentages of various categorical data,
* Box and Whisker Charts are used to see the Outliers and where is the majority data located.
